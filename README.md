# DSA Playground 

A C++ based Data Structures & Algorithms practice playground.

This repository contains implementations of core DSA concepts written from scratch
to strengthen fundamentals and problem-solving skills.

##  Topics Covered
- Arrays
  - Traversal
  - Insertion & Deletion
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
  - Max / Min
  - Reverse Array

- Singly Linked List
	- Insert at Head
	- Insert at Tail
	- Delete by Value
	- Search
	- Length
	- Display
	- Reverse Linked List

- Doubly Linked list
	- Insert at Head
	- Insert at Tail
	- Delete by Value
	- Display forward
	- Display backward
	- Length

##  Tech Stack
- Language: C++
- Compiler: g++
- OS: Linux

## How to Run
- Clone the repository:
	- git clone https://github.com/abhishekmail-prog/DSA-Playground.git
	- cd DSA-Playground

- Compile and Run:
